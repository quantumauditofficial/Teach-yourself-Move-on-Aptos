Items marked read are to be completed before the beginning of the next item, but may be begun before the prior item.
It may be easier to break up reading and start early, interspersing with tutorials.
When a tutorial is marked do, re-write all code.
Do not download sample code.
Do not copy-paste.
If necessary, running from within a provided repo is necessary as long as it is solely in the interest of duplicating behavior to be expected from the already re-written repo.
When an item is marked explore, consider the following:
Re-implement examples but with modifications.
Create your own new examples using the provided library/framework.
Read whatever seems interesting!
